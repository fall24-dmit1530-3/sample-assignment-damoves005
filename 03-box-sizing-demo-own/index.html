            <h1>MOBY-DICK; or, THE WHALE.</h1>
            <p>Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a
                wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last
                came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual
                exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious
                agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with half a heart and
                half a lung</p>
            <p>All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it;
                all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil,
                to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the
                whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and
                then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it</p>
            <p>"Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho!
                Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from
                hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all
                hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
                chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the spear!</p>
