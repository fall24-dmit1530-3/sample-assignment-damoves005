    What are fluid layouts?

    Fluid layouts are a design approach where the elements of a web page scale in size proportionally to the screen or
    browser window size. This type of layout ensures that content is flexible and adapts smoothly to different screen
    resolutions and device sizes, providing the best possible viewing experience on small mobile screens, large desktop
    monitors, and everything in between.

    What are their key characteristics?

    Widths: Instead of using fixed pixel values, fluid layouts use percentages for defining the widths of elements. This
    allows elements to adjust their size relative to the parent container, making the layout more adaptable.

    Flexible Grid Systems: Many fluid layouts are built on grid systems that are designed to be flexible. These grids
    often use a combination of percentages and media queries to adapt the number of columns and the size of the columns
    based on the viewport size.

    Responsive Images and Media: Fluid layouts often incorporate images and other media elements that scale with the
    container. Using properties like max-width: 100%; makes sure that images do not overflow their containers and scale
    down appropriately on smaller screens.

    What are the benefits of using fluid layouts?

    Improved User Experience

    By adapting to various screen sizes, fluid layouts ensure that users have a consistent experience, whether they are
    on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop computer. They can also help improve accessibility by ensuring that content
    remains readable and usable regardless of screen or viewport size.

    Future-Proofing (Maintainability)

    As new devices with different screen sizes and resolutions emerge, fluid layouts are more likely to accommodate
    these changes without requiring significant layout or website redesigns.
